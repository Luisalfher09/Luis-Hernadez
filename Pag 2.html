<p> This clothing brand was designed by three college students from three different countries, all 3 of different ages. They met during their college years, and one summer, they decided to meet one night to find a way to bring a message to the world: "Be the best version of yourself." "Help you be a better person physically, mentally, financially." For this project, we decided to create clothes. We start with this first collection of three garments with a minimalist design.</p>
<p>After creating this first collection, we decided it was time to show our designs to the public and see what they thought. Our first collection was taken to the country of one of the three boys, and all the garments were successfully sold.</p>
